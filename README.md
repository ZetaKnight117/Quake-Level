# The Mysterous Arena

This will be a Deathmach level. there willl be maximum number of 4 players that will be able to play. The map will be big but not to big as there will be unpredicable spawn points 
the map to stop player from spawn killing each other. The goal of the game is to beget more kills than the other players. There will aslo be other weapons spawned all over the map so watch out for them.
