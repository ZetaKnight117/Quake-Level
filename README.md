# The Mysterous Artifact 

This will be an adventure game and Some what of a mystery game.The setting of the level takes place ina temple. You willsoon find out that the temple id full if zombies You have to explore the temple and try to find a they to get a out of the the temple and get as many kills as you can.  Each key will be a certain location with a bunch of enemies and their leader as well. The goal of this game is to find a key and escape the temple. There are 4 keys and for players will be able to play. This is somewhat a maze so you might get lost. It's up to player to memeroize. The reason why I chose this is I want players to go beat other player. And This is one of the idea that i came up with.
