# The Mysterous Temple

This will be a Deathmach with a twist.The setting of the level takes place in a temple. You will soon find out that the temple id full if other living beings as you are fighting against other players. You have to explore the temple and try to get as many kills as you can.  Each area in the level will have npcs/ enemies with a bunch of enemies and their leader as well. The goal of this game is to find a key and escape the temple. There are 4 keys/Weapons and for players will be able to play. The reason why I chose this is I want players to go against other players but also have to get of the invaders in the temple at the same time. And This is one of the idea that I came up with. I want to have a level where it's an escape game but it's more players where you have to beat at the same time. You win the game by getting the most kills out of everyone player/and enemies.
The enemies are npcs to give it that vibe where the setting is not an abandon place.
